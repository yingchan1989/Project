# Project

The aim of this project is to create a deep reinforcement learning model, specifically using a off-policy deep learning algorithm such as Q-learning, coupled with neural networks (and also convolutional neural networks), in order to obtain artificial intelligence to play a game of Gomoku (five-in-a-row).
