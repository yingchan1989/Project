# Project: Deep Gaming

The aim of this project is to create a deep reinforcement learning model, specifically using a off-policy deep learning algorithm such as Q-learning, coupled with neural networks (and also convolutional neural networks), in order to obtain artificial intelligence to play a game of Gomoku (five-in-a-row).


## Feature engineering
The first two algorithms utilize traditonal neural networks and hence feature enginneering was used extensively to summarize the board game states.

Feature engineering items included extracting the columns, rows and diagonals, that house any placement of stones of the current player as well as the opponent player.
